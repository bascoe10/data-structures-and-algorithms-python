## Stacks

A stack is a dynamic data container that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last item insert would the first item deleted/removed from the stack.

Think of a stack like a set of plates with one on top of the other. The top plate would always be the first to be taken.

The following operations are supported by a stack:
|Operation|Runtime|
|---------|-------|
|push|$O(1)$|
|pop|$O(1)$|
|peek|$O(1)$|
|size|$O(1)$|
